		<h3>Can I upload my own file?</h3>
			<p>Not on this website. You can only link pictures that have already been uploaded onto the internet. If you would like to upload your own photo, I would suggest heading over to <a href="http://www.imgur.com">imgur.com</a> and upload it there. You can then get the link to the photo by right clicking it, and copy/paste that link here.</p>
		<h3>How do I print my creation?</h3>
			<p>Save your picture by clicking the save button. Fnd your file on your computer, and print it from there.</p>
		<h3>Can I undo the color I just placed?</h3>
			<p>Although there is no direct "undo" function, you can use the right click button on your mouse to remove any color from the square you just changed.</p>
		<h3>Can I save this and come back to it later?</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately, you cannot. The save button will only save the image to your computer, not to our servers.</p>
